to push from git to other git 

✅ Correct approach

Since you don’t have permission to push to the original repo, you should:

Push to your own fork (your GitHub account)

Optionally, create a pull request to the original repo if you want to contribute.

🔹 Step 1: Add your fork as origin

Assuming your fork is:

https://github.com/hytham20380/auto_wabp.git


Run:

git remote add origin https://github.com/hytham20380/auto_wabp.git


Check remotes:

git remote -v


You should now see:

origin    https://github.com/hytham20380/auto_wabp.git (fetch)
origin    https://github.com/hytham20380/auto_wabp.git (push)
upstream  https://github.com/ranamagdy/auto_wabp.git (fetch)
upstream  https://github.com/ranamagdy/auto_wabp.git (push)

🔹 Step 2: Push your branch to your fork
git push -u origin Dev


-u sets your local Dev branch to track origin/Dev

After this, you can just do git push in future

🔹 Step 3: Create a Pull Request (optional)

If you want to contribute to the original repo:

Go to your fork on GitHub (https://github.com/hytham20380/auto_wabp)

Click Compare & pull request

Submit a PR to ranamagdy/auto_wabp

-------------
2️⃣ Check GitHub Actions / status checks

Go to Actions tab or PR page

Make sure all required tests pass (e.g., Cypress workflow)

Some repos block merging until CI passes

3️⃣ Request a review (if needed)

On the PR page, click Reviewers → add a collaborator from the original repo

Wait for approval if branch protection requires it

4️⃣ Once all requirements are met

GitHub will enable the Merge button

Then you can merge your changes into Dev on Rana’s repo

If you want, I can give you a step-by-step sequence to safely sync your branch with upstream Dev, push it, and unblock the PR for merging.
